# The manual gate does not travel this way, and saying so is the whole of what this
# script can honestly do about it. `plugins/telegram-dev/hooks/` is a PreToolUse hook that
# refuses a refund, a payout, a live key and the free-money path; the plugin channel loads
# it from the plugin manifest, and this channel copies skill directories only.
#
# `bin/telegram-dev.js` has printed this since v0.7.0 and this script printed nothing — the
# more dangerous of the two channels, since it `rm -rf`s each destination first. Writing to
# the operator's `~/.claude/settings.json` is deliberately NOT done: it is a file they own
# and did not write, with no version control behind it, and the family umbrella carries two
# defects in its own history from doing exactly that. So the step is printed and left.
